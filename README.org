* my dwl configuration
The repo is a fork of https://github.com/djpohly/dwl with
- a bunch of patches applied (see [[./myscripts/apply-patches.sh]]),
- my custom part of the config in [[./myconfig.c]] and
- support for usage as a nix flake.

see [[./README.md]] for the upstream original readme and licensing information.
